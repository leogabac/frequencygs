# Data

Data can be a mess to organize. Here I will provide an overview on what each file is supposed to have, their schema, and goal.

## File tree

The file structure can be confusing. Here is an overview:
```
.
├── forces
├── states
└── SIMULATION
    └── SIZE
        ├── TOTAL TIME
        │   ├── FIELD
        │   │   └── frames
```
Therefore, a trajectory located at `./test11/10/1/11mT/trj3.csv`:
1. Is generated by `test11.py`
2. Has a `SIZE=10` per side.
3. Has a $\tau$ `TOTAL_TIME=1`, hence $\omega=\pi/2/\tau$.
4. Has a $B$ `FIELD=11` of 11mT.
5. Is the third realization of the experiment.

## The SIZE Directory

Under the `SIZE` directory there are BULK computations, i.e. values that are computed for all fields, frequencies, and frames. The goal of these files is to have summarized in one file the data from which figures are made.
